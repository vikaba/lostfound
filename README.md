## Lost and found web app

Create the db in your local MySQL by running the lostfound.sql file.
Change the creds in [backend/db.js](https://github.com/vikaba/lostfound/blob/master/backend/db.js) if needed.

Then, to run both the frontend and backend via:

```
npm start
```

Then, navigate to http://localhost:8081.
You should be able to view all reported lost items.
Upon registering and logging in, you should be able to also now report new lost items.
